## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- joblib

## ðŸ““ Notebook Content
- Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Data Visualization (Pie Charts, Histograms, Count Plots, Correlation Heatmap)
- Outlier Handling
- Data Preprocessing (Mapping, Scaling)
- Linear Regression: Model training, Evaluation (MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ² scores)
- Polynomial Regression model training and Evaluation (degree = 1, degree = 2)
- Experimenting with features (Removing low correlation features)
- 
## ðŸš€ Summary
- The model performs best using the Linear Regression model and using the Polynomial Regression at degree = 1, otherwise, the RÂ² value slightly drops
